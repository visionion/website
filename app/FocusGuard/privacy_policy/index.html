      <h1>FocusGuard Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Last updated: December 15, 2025</p>

      <p>
        FocusGuard is a site blocker built to help you stay focused. We designed it to respect your privacy.
        FocusGuard does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or sell your personal data.
      </p>

      <h2>What data is stored</h2>
      <p>
        FocusGuard stores settings and usage information <strong>locally on your device</strong> using the browser’s storage.
        This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export it. Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Blocked sites, whitelist, and categories you choose</li>
        <li>Schedules and Focus Mode timers</li>
        <li>Usage limits per site and minutes used (for enforcement)</li>
        <li>Local insights counters (e.g., number of blocked attempts)</li>
        <li>Extension preferences and settings</li>
        <li>Optional lock password (stored as a one-way hash) and hint</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Permissions we request and why</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>storage</strong>: Save your preferences and data locally</li>
        <li><strong>tabs</strong> and <strong>activeTab</strong>: Determine the current site to enforce your rules</li>
        <li><strong>alarms</strong>: Run scheduled tasks (e.g., focus sessions, resets)</li>
        <li><strong>declarativeNetRequest</strong> (+ feedback): Efficiently block matching sites by rule</li>
        <li><strong>host permissions: &lt;all_urls&gt;</strong>: Allow blocking on sites you choose across the web</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These permissions are used solely to provide core blocking functionality. FocusGuard does not send this information to external servers.
      </p>

      <h2>Third‑party services</h2>
      <p>
        FocusGuard does not use third‑party analytics, ad networks, or tracking pixels. There are no external servers receiving your data.
      </p>

      <h2>Export and import</h2>
      <p>
        You may export your FocusGuard data for backup and import it later. Exports exclude sensitive information such as your password hash.
      </p>

      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this policy to reflect product or legal changes. We will update the “Last updated” date above when changes occur.
      </p>
